        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&#8220;Damn it!&#8221; exclaimed Marcus, as he slammed his fingers on the keys in frustration. He had messed
            up that bit again. It was a difficult piece to play, but he should have gotten it down by now, or at least,
            that&#8217;s how he felt. A lifetime spent behind the instrument and he was still making silly amateurish
            mistakes. The fact that this was a week before the most important performance of his life only added to his
            frustration. He let out a sigh and started from the top once again, determined to get it right even if it
            took him all night. Even if his flight was the morning after, he did not care. He couldn&#8217;t mess this
            opportunity up.</p>
        <p>He found himself regretting that decision of staying up all night the very next morning though. He was never
            one to sleep on the plane and his journey was a long and uncomfortable one. Never had he been so glad to
            finally get out of the plane at the journey&#8217;s end. At arriving at his destination, he went straight to
            his hotel room and immediately crashed. His sleep was deep and refreshing. By the time he got up, it was
            already dark outside. It took him a while to rid himself of the grogginess one felt after sleeping for too
            long. He eventually straightened out his thoughts and freshened up. Finally, he got some food to silence his
            grumbling stomach before heading out to the Auditorium.</p>
        <p>The Auditorium was just as big as it was in the pictures he saw when he was a mere boy. It was every soloists
            dream to be up there and he was no different. He worked day and night for years on end to get there. The
            Auditorium was a physical manifestation of his lifelong goals. The fact that he was standing before it,
            moments away from reaching that goal made his heart race.</p>
        <p>He had performed at the Auditorium once before, but that was with the Philharmonic. Playing that show was
            surreal and he felt that was the closest he would come to his dream. He was taken aback even then. However,
            this time, it would be his own stage. This was everything he envisioned to achieve when he set out on his
            path. It was everything he worked towards since the day he decided he would walk this road. He remembered
            how excited he was when he first got the phone call inviting him to perform. He also remembered how that
            excitement slowly turned to nervousness as the days went by. He lost count of the number of times he threw
            up during practice sessions. The thought of failure would send him spiraling out of control. This was not
            only his biggest opportunity to establish himself as one of the great soloists of modern time, but it was
            also a chance to prove himself to be the greatest flop of modern time. A single note out of place or in the
            wrong tempo and he was well on his way to bury all his ambitions in one fell sweep. The world of music was
            cruel and relentless, and none knew that better than he, an aspiring musician wanting to climb up the
            echelons of this very world.</p>
        <p>Once he reached the venue, he found it to be closed off. He found a guard and managed to convince him to
            allow him inside even at that hour when no one else was around. (Perks of having your face up in posters all
            around the place). He had specific instructions to the organizers for setting up a practice room in there so
            he could not only brush up on his playing, but also get a feel for the venue and he was told that everything
            was taken care of before he got there. Thus, he set out inside to find this room and work on the piece once
            more.</p>
        <p>The place was quite enormous and he eventually found himself lost as he tried to find the aforementioned
            practice room. He looked around desperately and only ended up going in circles. Eventually he gave up and
            decided to go back and ask the guard for directions or maybe even a map. Though instead of finding his way
            back to the area he was in, he found himself in an entirely different place. This part of the Auditorium
            looked much older than the rest. There were wooden floors and the plaster on some of the walls were coming
            off. Marcus was quite confused as he walked through the run down building before he finally remembered how
            the Auditorium went through renovations about six years prior. This was the part of the old auditorium that
            they did not end up fixing for whatever reason.</p>
        <p>The inside of the Auditorium was already not well lit up due to it being closed at the time. This section of
            it, however, was completely dark. The only light coming through was from the windows. Luckily it was a full
            moon outside, so Marcus could see well enough to walk on. As he traversed the aged corridor, trying to find
            his way back, he suddenly stopped in his tracks. He had heard something. It was faint at first, but as
            Marcus stepped forward, it grew louder. He made it out to be music. As he got closer, it was clear to him
            what sound that was. He could recognize it anywhere. It was piano music.</p>
        <p>To anyone else, this combination of dark, old abandoned building and strange music coming from the unknown,
            would have been obvious red flags. To someone whose only train of thought was &#8220;Must practice&#8221;
            like Marcus however, it was a golden opportunity. His thoughts were something along the lines of :
            &#8220;Not only was a room with a piano right ahead, meaning I could finally get some practice done, but
            there was also a pianist playing some beautiful melodies. Maybe this mystery pianist could even direct me to
            my practice room. Heck, maybe the room with the music coming out of it <em>IS</em> my practice room &#8220;.
            Without a moment to lose, Marcus sprinted off in to the direction of the music and found himself in front of
            a run-down door. Behind this door, he could hear a beautiful melody being played. It&#8217;s a song he had
            never heard before, but it&#8217;s tune was sweet and yet, had a tinge of sorrow. Marcus stopped for a
            second, took and deep breath, and went ahead and opened the door. What he saw after that froze him in place.
            His eyes widened in bewilderment and fear and a chill ran down his spine. He was terrified and enchanted all
            at the same time. A strange combination of emotions, befitting of the strange situation he found himself in.
