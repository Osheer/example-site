            <p class="desc">Hailing from a country in the far yonder of a the world, I contemplated many things in my
                youth.
                This is but a mere collection, or rather, a contemplation of days past and thoughts expressed in

                <p>“Damn it!” exclaimed Marcus, as he slammed his fingers on the keys in frustration. He had messed up

                    confused with the cult classic cartoon that is “Dexter’s Laboratory”, this was a show that followed

                <p>Dear Dreamers,

                    I’d like you to think about three words: “Follow your dreams”. Three words that have supposedly
                    shaped lives. Three words that is the premise to an immeasurable number of movies and narratives.
