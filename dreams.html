        <h2>Reality of Dreams</h2>
        <p>Dear Dreamers,</p>
        <p>I&#8217;d like you to think about three words: &#8220;Follow your dreams&#8221;. Three words that have
            supposedly
            shaped lives. Three words that is the premise to an immeasurable number of movies and narratives. Three
            words
            that have &#8220;inspired&#8221; hope among the youth since the dawn of time. Three words that have even
            become
            a cliche by now due to the amount by which they have been used (and misused). Follow. Your. Dreams.</p>
        <p>Do you know what most of these narratives and movies fail to show however? What any of these inspirational
            speeches built on the premise of &#8220;follow your dreams&#8221; conveniently choose to leave out?
            It&#8217;s
            that sometimes, or rather, a lot of times, your plan does not work out. Sometimes, when you feel like
            you&#8217;re flying high and are just about to attain all that you&#8217;ve worked so hard for, your wings
            get
            clipped and you fall back down to reality. And in that moment you realize just how out of depth you were.
            This
            is followed by immeasurable pain; pain that you felt from falling down from such a height, pain that feels
            like
            it will never really go away, constantly resonating inside of you. You try to get back up but everywhere you
            look now, all you see is a colossal wall blocking your path. A never ending wall that not only stops you
            from
            moving forward, but also restrains your line of vision. You can&#8217;t see and you can&#8217;t move and all
            you
            can feel is this earth shattering feeling of being broken inside. And for a moment, perhaps the longest
            moment
            in all of eternity, you genuinely feel &#8220;stuck&#8221;.</p>
        <p>These are perhaps the harsher realities of life. Sometimes that&#8217;s all what &#8220;following your
            dreams&#8221; gets you; gut-wrenching pain and a bitter taste in your mouth that never really leaves. Does
            that
            mean I think you should all stop following our dreams? Absolutely not.</p>
        <p>You see, the problem isn&#8217;t in the fact that you can&#8217;t always achieve everything in the way you
            want
            to. The problem is in what you choose to do after. There is a famous saying that goes something like it
            doesn&#8217;t matter how someone gets knocked down but how they get back up that truly defines them.
            That&#8217;s pretty much where the issue arises. So many people, once knocked back down and left
            &#8220;broken&#8221; by having their dreams shattered never bother to get back up. It is by no means an easy
            task to &#8220;get back up&#8221; after something like that. Your entire body and soul screams as you try
            and it
            takes every fiber of your being to get you started. However, once you&#8217;ve started down that road, you
            can
            truly look at things from a different perspective.</p>
        <p>Do not shy away from your past failures. Look at them straight up and try to analyze where things went wrong.
            Don&#8217;t dwell on them too much though; only enough to find your mistake and learn from it. They say
            people
            are doomed to repeat the same mistakes and this only happens because these people are too afraid or prideful
            to
            really look at their own flaws. Don&#8217;t be one of those people.</p>
        <p>Use your past as fuel for your future. And then, by all means, follow your dreams. Follow them with all your
            heart, and if you fail again, then get back up and try once more. And a couple more times if need be.
            Persistence is key after all. See that&#8217;s what they don&#8217;t show in the movies. They just show a
            character facing a couple of hardships and overcoming them to fulfill his ambitions. But life doesn&#8217;t
            run
            on a 2 hour or 3 hour run-time limit for a lot of us. The path that leads to your goals is a long and
            difficult
            one, filled with many of the aforementioned walls blocking your path. They will keep knocking you down over
            and
            over again. It won&#8217;t be pretty and it will most definitely not be easy. It was never meant to be. But
            when
            you finally get to the other side; when you finally reach the thing you spent blood, sweat, and tears,
            trying to
            achieve, there will be no need to feel some false sense of happiness vicariously through some written
            characters. Euphoria will be an understatement for what courses through you and all the hurt and ache of the
            past will be nothing more than a memory.</p>
        <p>So, by all means, get up and try. For it is only then that you will truly learn to heal.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Sincerely yours,</p>
        <p>A broken man who had his dreams shattered.</p>
