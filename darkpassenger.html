        <h2>Dark Passengers</h2>
        <p>I remember a few years back there was a television show that used to air called “Dexter”. Not to be confused
            with the cult classic cartoon that is “Dexter’s Laboratory”, this was a show that followed the exploits of a
            serial killer in Miami as he struggled to find balance with his personal life and his “extracurricular
            activities”. Now in this show, our main character, Dexter, used to refer to his urge or compulsion to kill
            as his “dark passenger”. It was an urge so strong that it took control of his entire life and made him
            spiral out of control unless he acted on it.</p>
        <p>Though not all of us (hopefully) have to deal with an intense urge to kill like our pal Dexter, it is still
            highly likely that we have our own “dark passengers” that are constantly nagging at us and trying to take
            control of our lives. More often than not, this comes in the form of our very own thoughts.</p>
        <p>“I…can’t do this.””This is too much for me.””I’m way in over my head”. How many times have we said these
            things to ourselves when faced with a difficult situation? Things like this not only make us feel bad, but
            it helps put up a mental barrier of sorts that stops us from reaching our goals. It’s like we are the ones
            who is ultimately limiting ourselves and subconsciously stopping ourselves from achieving what we want. The
            phrase “You are your own worst enemy” never rang so true.</p>
        <p>It’s not even just that though. There are so many ways that our thoughts can be intrusive. Whether it be
            trying to talk to a girl (or guy) for the first time and thinking “Oh never mind, that’s so awkward. I’ll
            probably give off the wrong impression,” or trying to talk your boss in to giving you a raise for how hard
            you’ve been working and backing out last second by thinking “Ah no, I don’t think I worked THAT hard,” these
            thoughts are always popping up trying to make us feel less than we actually are. They are always trying to
            make you doubt ourselves and our abilities. This is the real “dark passenger” folks.</p>
        <p>So what do we do about these thoughts? Well the simple answer would just be to ignore them and go about your
            day but it is so much harder than it sounds. This self-doubt is like this extremely annoying person who
            constantly looks over your shoulder and judges you for EVERYTHING you do. “Oh you’re going to wear that
            today?” “Hah, really&#8230;That’s the witty reply you came up with after thinking for so long?” “You really
            don’t think all the people here are noticing that little ketchup stain on your shirt?” It just goes on and
            on. To drown it out is like trying to write the most vivid descriptions of the most blissful place on Earth,
            while you have Metallica playing in the back.</p>
        <p>So ignoring it isn’t an option then. What now? Well, imagine you had a pet dog that wasn’t properly trained.
            It loves to bark like its front-lining a concert at 3 a.m. in the morning and your neighbors have just about
            had enough with your dog (and you). So what do you do? You work to teach it some manners. You tell your dog
            to shut up and stay put. It doesn’t work out at first. In fact, it takes quite a while before your dog
            learns to listen, but when it does, it’s pretty smooth sailing from then on. Mr. Dark Passenger here is
            pretty much just like this metaphoric pet dog, only a bit less civilized. Every time an ounce of self-doubt
            creeps up and tells you that you can’t do something, you tell it to shut the f*** up. Excuse the vulgarity,
            but there’s really no other way to emphasize it. You just tell it to shut up and watch you. You are the
            person who knows you best and who knows your abilities best. Don’t let some voice in your head tell you
            whether you can or can’t do something. You want to go talk to the cute girl at the library, just go for it.
            Don’t let those thoughts telling you “Oh she’s out of your league bro” stop you. You want to write a novel
            or work on a 10 minute solo piano composition; you go right ahead and do it. Do not let the crippling
            thoughts of you not being good enough or not having enough dedication stop you. There’s a very corny saying
            that goes “You are the master of your own destiny, “and though the situation is nearly not as dramatic as
            when that saying is usually used, the words still ring true in this case. Tame that sketchy passenger and
            watch your true potential come to life.</p>
        <p>I probably sound like a wannabe motivational speaker with over the top preachy lines here but I felt the need
            to share this. There are so many instances in the past and even now where I missed out on valuable
            opportunities simply because I doubted myself and my abilities. Don’t let the same happen to you. Keep in
            mind that Dexter was a problematic individual with a wide range of mental disorders. That’s probably why he
            continued to feed this dark passenger of his, leading to his eventual downfall. Do not feed it. Control it.
            It might always be a part of you, but remember that you are its master, and not the other way round.</p>
